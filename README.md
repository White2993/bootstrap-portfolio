# bootstrap-portfolio

Simultaneously easier and more difficult than the original portfolio page.
It would seem as though practicing markup would make things go more smoothly.
Learned a little more about using em and % to size an element relative to the parent instead of just using a hard px val. (duh)
Bootstrap in general makes resizing quite a bit easier. Super.

Really the only challenges faced were making the navbar at least look passable when sizing for different screens, as well as keeping text from spilling out of the body box. (Again showing me why in a lot of cases sizing with a px value is a no-no.)

Est. time to completion: 6-ish hours?
